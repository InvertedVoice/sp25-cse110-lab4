## discountprices functions

1. Answer: 3 <br>
in the *discountPrices* function, there is a *for* loop, which has a variable *i* that starts at 0, and every time the loop is performed whenever i is smaller than the array size of the prices, it is increased by 1. And note that the *i* is defined by a VAR, and not LET, which means that it is once again function-scoped, meaning the value of *i* will still exist outside of the loop. Since the size of the prices array is 3 [100, 200, 300], the loop will stop performing once i becomes 3. Thus, the loop will be performed 3 times, increasing the value of i by 1 a total of 3 times, which will give us a final value of i = 3.
